# Setting Up the Environment

## Setting Up a Github Repository

1. Create a public github repository(for convenience choose 'initialize with README' option)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
        git clone [your repository url]

3. Create 'dev' branch using the following command:
    
        git checkout -b dev
    
    You will use this branch to develop your project along the course.
   
4. Commit and push the code you have written so far in 'dev' branch (don't forget to add 
   .gitignore file with all IDE-specific files to the root of your project). You can use .gitignore 
   generators(or just copy from here https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/java,maven,intellij+iml) 
   
5. Create a pull request from 'dev' to 'master' branch and assign review to [me](https://github.com/igorgoose).
   You will perform steps 4 and 5 after completing each task.
