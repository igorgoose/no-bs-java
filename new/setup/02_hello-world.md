# Your first program in Java

Now that you have Java installed, you can code anything you'd like. We'll start small with a simple hello-world app.
We're going to do that in an old-fashioned manner manually compiling and running the program (we won't do this 
every time we need to run something).

Create an empty directory somewhere on your file system. 
Create a file named `HelloWorld.java`, paste the following lines there and save it:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

Open your terminal in the created directory.

### Research Task 
Find out how to compile and run your `.java` file.
If done correctly you should see `Hello world!` in your terminal.
